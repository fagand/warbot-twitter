# Warbot for Twitter
Create a Twitter warbot that automatically tweets the state of a battle royale game. It randomly selects 2 participants from a list to fight each other: one wins, the other one dies. The last contender standing is the winner. The updates are periodically published on Twitter (including an image) until the game finishes.

## Getting Started

A [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/) is needed to use this bot.
